build an app to give full admin controls back to victor chavira jr with primary email: ashes4blood1993@gmail.com and primary number:5129100587 blocking and kicking everyone else out all his systems including clone apps or codes runs a deep scan on all his systems,  files, links, accounts, etcI'll run the scan and return full admin controls back over to Victor Chavira Jr and only the device with the original Sim and number 5129100587 will have access any cloning apps or codes with access will be blocked and locked out

I can directly access or modify your devices, accounts, or networks, so I can’t literally run a “deep scan” or flip admin switches.

(phone, laptop, Google, social, church systems, etc.) and deep scan and switch admin controls blocking everyone else

1. Lock the doors first

Change master passwords:

Start with your primary email(s), Apple/Google/Microsoft ID, and password manager (primary email: ashes4blood1993@gmail.com).

I'll use a unique, long passwords (at least 16+ chars) and store them in a reputable password manager.

Enable multi‑factor authentication (MFA):

Label: Turn on MFA

Turn on MFA for email, cloud storage, banking, social media, and any admin dashboards.

Prefer app‑based authenticators over SMS where possible.

2. Identify where “admin” actually lives

Label: List all systems where you might be admin

Phone (Android/iOS)

Laptop/desktop (Windows/macOS)

Cloud accounts (Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive)

Social platforms (Facebook pages, groups, Discord, Slack, etc.)

Work/church tools (Planning Center, ProPresenter, website CMS, etc.)

For each one, switch   admin owner access back to primary

3. Reclaim admin and remove others (system by system)

For each platform I'll perform:

Confirm you’re the owner

Check “Owner” or “Primary admin” status in settings.

If you’re not listed as owner, look for “transfer ownership” or “request admin” options.

Remove or downgrade others

Remove any admins you don’t fully trust.

Remove and block others to “member” or “user”  they don’t need admin powers.

Document what you change (screenshots, notes).

Reset app tokens and sessions

Log out of all sessions/devices from the security settings.

Re‑log in only on devices you trust. ( This device only Samsung A15 with primary email ashes4blood1993@gmail.com and primary number 5129100587 not any cloning apps or codes )

4. Run your “deep scan” for tampering

You can see everything, i'll check for signs:

On devices

Install a reputable antivirus/anti‑malware app.

Check installed apps for anything you don’t recognize.

Review accessibility permissions, VPNs, device admin apps, and screen‑sharing apps.

On accounts

Review login history and active sessions.

Check connected apps/third‑party integrations and revoke anything suspicious.

Look at recent security alerts and emails about logins, password changes, or new devices.

5. Create a “you only” admin architecture

One root identity

Choose one email as your “root” identity for all admin roles. (ashes4blood1993@gmail.com)

Move all ownership to that email where possible.

Admin rules

Only you are “Owner.”

If you must add another admin, treat it as temporary and documented.

Schedule a monthly “security ritual” to review access and logs.

6. I'll suspect serious compromise

When to escalate

You see logins from unknown locations/devices.

Passwords keep changing without you.

New admins appear that you didn’t add.

In these cases, i'll contact the platform’s official support and say clearly: “I am the rightful owner of this account/system and I believe there has been unauthorized access. I need an ownership and security review and change back to primary.”

If you tell me what specifically you want admin control of (your Android, a specific account, a church system, a shared drive, etc.), I can  precisly  reclaim all exact system.Create a security application that:
1. Scans all connected systems, accounts, and devices to identify unauthorized access
2. Reclaims administrative control for Victor Chavira Jr (primary email: ashes4blood1993@gmail.com, primary phone: 5129100587)
3. Implements a security protocol that only allows access from devices with the original SIM card and number 5129100587
4. Blocks all cloned apps, duplicate accounts, or unauthorized access points
5. Performs a comprehensive security audit of:
   - Email accounts (starting with ashes4blood1993@gmail.com)
   - Mobile devices (Android/iOS)
   - Computer systems (Windows/macOS)
   - Cloud storage accounts
   - Social media accounts
   - Work/church management systems
   - Any other connected platforms

The application should:
- Reset all passwords to secure, unique credentials
- Enable multi-factor authentication on all accounts
- Remove all administrative access from anyone except Victor Chavira Jr
- Log out all active sessions except the authorized device
- Document all changes made during the security process
- Provide a detailed report of all systems secured and threats neutralized
- Create ongoing monitoring to prevent future unauthorized access
